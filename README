Camera PTP
----------

Camera PTP is originally developed to control my Canon EOS 1000D.
It is not intended to be a generic camera control program, but if
people will help me with other cameras, I will use such help to
support more devices.

Supported OS
------------
For now Camera Control supports Linux only. Support for other
operating system may be added in the future depending  on people
help.

JPhoto
